        <p>
            Authored the paper <em>"Detection, Classification and Quantification of HUrtful HUmor (HUHU) on Twitter Using Classical Models, Ensemble Models, and Transformers"</em> (IberLEF @ SEPLN, 2023).
            Developed NLP pipelines to distinguish between benign jokes and prejudiced humor using Transformer architectures.

        <p>
            Designed and tested an embedded control system for the levitation of a Hyperloop vehicle. Utilized <strong>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</strong> algorithms to optimize magnetic levitation stability dynamically. This work was part of the Hyperloop UPV team competition entry.
