                I proudly carry the values of the Culture of Effort and my Valencian identity. Professionally, I have two core passions whose combination I firmly believe can help change the world:

                Artificial Intelligence — as thrilling as it is complex. My goal is to dive deep into its algorithms and apply them ethically and purposefully, for the benefit of society.

                Communication — the driving force behind collaboration and innovation. It’s essential for teaching, inspiring, connecting, negotiating, and building strong relationships. Without it, ideas wither.

            <p>
                My path is built on these pillars: from leading the Hyperloop UPV team—where cutting-edge technology and communication unite to solve international challenges—to the "Salvem les fotos" project, where AI helps recover the collective memory of those affected by the DANA floods.
