                I am currently pursuing my <strong>Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS)</strong> at the <strong>University of Southern California (USC)</strong> in Los Angeles.

                My academic journey began at the <strong>Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV)</strong>, where I developed a strong foundation in computer engineering. In 2024, I was honored to be selected as a <strong>Fulbright Scholar</strong>, a distinction that supported my transition to the U.S. to further my research in Artificial Intelligence.

                Beyond the lab and lecture hall, I am a competitive athlete. I play <strong>FIBA 3x3 Basketball</strong>, having competed nationally in Spain. This experience has taught me the value of quick decision-making, teamwork, and resilience—skills I apply daily to my engineering challenges.
